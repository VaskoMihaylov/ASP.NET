<div>There are demos available for a great variety of computing platforms. Currently, most new demos are 
 native-code programs designed to run on PCs under the Microsoft Windows operating system[citation needed], 
 but demos are still actively being made for many other machines including old and new computers, consoles
 and mobile devices such as PDAs, mobile phones and pocket calculators.

<p>Unlike mainstream retrocomputing, the activity of creating demos for old computers is more commonly associated
 with technical challenge than nostalgic feelings.[citation needed] The accomplishment of new and groundbreaking
 things is a major driving force on the demoscene, and the limits of various pieces of "obsolete" hardware are
 still being pushed forward by several groups. Even many PC-oriented democoders do some programming on more
 restricted platforms in order to get in touch with ways of democoding that are no longer available on modern PCs.
